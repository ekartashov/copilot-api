## Core Methodology: Progressive Enhancement Framework

### Philosophy

**"Systematic Enhancement Through Strategic Analysis"**

The methodology prioritizes:
1. **Security First**: Immediate identification and resolution of sensitive data exposure
2. **Critical Path**: Address blocking issues before optimization
3. **Strategic Relationships**: Build meaningful connections, not superficial links
4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Verify claims against actual implementation
5. **Sustainable Processes**: Create maintainable long-term governance

---

## 6-Category Classification Framework

### Category 1: Security-Sensitive Content üîí
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE (Security vulnerabilities)

**Identification Criteria:**
- API keys, tokens, passwords in documentation
- Personal information (emails, real names, addresses)
- Sensitive configuration details
- Authentication credentials

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Immediate Quarantine**: Flag for urgent review
2. **Content Sanitization**: Remove or redact sensitive data
3. **Security Audit**: Verify no related exposures
4. **Documentation**: Record security measures taken

**Tools Used:**
- `search_custom_data_value_fts` for keyword scanning
- `search_decisions_fts` for decision content review
- Manual inspection of large text blocks

### Category 2: Critical Documentation Conflicts ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Priority:** HIGH (Blocking AI agent effectiveness)

**Identification Criteria:**
- Contradictory information between ConPort and codebase
- Outdated documentation claiming current status
- Implementation claims without verification
- Environment variable naming conflicts

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Conflict Detection**: Compare ConPort data with actual implementation
2. **Source of Truth Determination**: Prioritize working code over documentation
3. **Evidence Gathering**: Collect proof from codebase examination
4. **Resolution Documentation**: Create correction records

**Example Resolution Process (Environment Variable Conflict):**
```
Issue: Decision D-24 vs ProjectGlossary conflict on variable naming
Investigation: Examine src/lib/token-parser.ts for actual usage
Evidence: 56 GH_TOKEN* references found in codebase
Resolution: Decision D-25 corrects documentation to match reality
Pattern: Apply SP-8 (Documentation Conflict Resolution Pattern)
```

### Category 3: Relationship Enhancement Opportunities üîó
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH (Knowledge graph optimization)

**Identification Criteria:**
- Decisions implementing system patterns
- Progress tracking specific decisions
- Pattern evolution chains
- Problem-solution mappings

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Connection Analysis**: Identify natural relationships
2. **Relationship Type Selection**: Choose meaningful relationship names
3. **Strategic Linking**: Avoid over-connection, focus on value
4. **Validation**: Verify relationships make sense bidirectionally

**Relationship Types Established:**
- `implements` - Decision implements pattern
- `validates_implementation_of` - Verification relationship
- `builds_on` - Progressive development
- `culminates_in` - Architecture evolution
- `identifies_problem_solved_by` - Problem-solution mapping

### Category 4: Pattern Extraction Candidates üìã
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Reusable knowledge creation)

**Identification Criteria:**
- Successful problem-solving approaches
- Reusable processes and methodologies
- Common architectural solutions
- Best practices emerging from decisions

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring successful approaches
2. **Abstraction**: Extract generalizable principles
3. **Documentation**: Create clear, actionable patterns
4. **Tagging**: Apply relevant tags for discoverability

**Pattern Quality Criteria:**
- **Reusable**: Applicable to similar future situations
- **Specific**: Clear steps and implementation guidance
- **Validated**: Proven successful in actual use
- **Well-Tagged**: Easy to discover and categorize

### Category 5: Archive-Ready Historical Data üìö
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM (Storage optimization)

**Identification Criteria:**
- Completed tasks (DONE status) older than 90 days
- Superseded decisions with better alternatives
- Verbose implementation details with low access frequency
- Historical exploratory work no longer relevant

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Completion Verification**: Confirm work is truly finished
2. **Historical Value Assessment**: Determine preservation worth
3. **Export Preparation**: Use ConPort markdown export
4. **Selective Archival**: Preserve core decisions, archive details

**Archive Guidelines:**
- **Never Archive**: Core decisions, system patterns, active links
- **Selective Archive**: Verbose details, outdated implementation specifics
- **Full Archive**: Exploratory work, superseded approaches

### Category 6: Knowledge Graph Optimization üï∏Ô∏è
**Priority:** ONGOING (Connectivity enhancement)

**Identification Criteria:**
- Isolated nodes (decisions/patterns without connections)
- Weak connectivity clusters
- Missing logical relationships
- Opportunities for cross-referencing

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Network Analysis**: Identify connectivity gaps
2. **Strategic Bridge Building**: Connect isolated areas
3. **Hub Enhancement**: Strengthen key decision/pattern nodes
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure connections add value

## Token Management Strategy

### 80K Constraint Management

**Challenge:** Comprehensive analysis within context limits  
**Solution:** Strategic constraint management

#### Efficient Tool Usage Patterns

**Pattern 1: Targeted Retrieval**
```
Instead of: get_decisions (all)
Use: search_decisions_fts (specific keywords)
Benefit: 70% token reduction, focused results
```

**Pattern 2: Progressive Analysis**
```
Phase 1: Recent activity (last 24h)
Phase 2: Specific categories (testing, config)
Phase 3: Strategic relationships
Benefit: Manageable chunks, better focus
```

**Pattern 3: Batch Operations**
```
Instead of: Multiple individual link_conport_items calls
Use: Plan relationships, execute in logical groups
Benefit: Context retention, relationship coherence
```

#### Content Optimization Techniques

**Structured Summaries:**
- Extract key points from verbose decisions
- Create pattern abstractions from detailed implementations
- Use concise relationship descriptions

**Progressive Detail:**
- Start with high-level overview
- Drill down into specific areas as needed
- Maintain context through structured analysis

**Smart Caching:**
- Identify stable content (product context, system patterns)
- Structure prompts for provider-specific caching
- Balance token costs with performance gains

## Critical Issue Resolution Process

### Environment Variable Conflict Resolution (Case Study)

#### Issue Discovery
**Symptom:** Inconsistent environment variable naming in documentation
**Detection Method:** Cross-referencing decisions with ProjectGlossary entries
**Initial Assessment:** Potential implementation failure or documentation error

#### Investigation Process
```
Step 1: Code Examination
Tool: Manual code review (src/lib/token-parser.ts)
Finding: Application uses GH_TOKEN* variants (lines 13, 38, 72)

Step 2: Evidence Gathering  
Tool: Project-wide search for variable patterns
Finding: 56 references to GH_TOKEN* pattern across codebase

Step 3: Decision History Review
Tool: get_decisions (D-24 specific)
Finding: Decision D-24 correctly claimed implementation

Step 4: Documentation Source Analysis
Tool: get_custom_data (ProjectGlossary)
Finding: ConPort documentation was outdated/incorrect
```

#### Resolution Implementation
```
Correction Decision: Log Decision D-25 as correction record
Pattern Application: Apply SP-8 (Documentation Conflict Resolution)
Documentation Update: Correct ProjectGlossary entries
Validation: Verify consistency across all documentation
```

#### Prevention Measures
- Code-first documentation principle
- Regular reconciliation reviews
- Implementation evidence requirements
- Change validation workflows
