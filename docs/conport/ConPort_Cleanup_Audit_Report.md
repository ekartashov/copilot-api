## Critical Issue Resolution

### Environment Variable Conflict Resolution

**Issue Identified:** Critical conflict between Decision D-24 and ConPort ProjectGlossary documentation regarding environment variable naming.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Decision D-24 claimed implementation of GITHUB_TOKEN* â†’ GH_TOKEN* standardization
- ConPort documentation incorrectly stated application still used GITHUB_TOKEN* variants
- Code examination revealed D-24 was **correctly implemented**

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Code Verification**: Examined `src/lib/token-parser.ts` for actual implementation
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Found 56 references using GH_TOKEN* pattern across codebase
3. **Source of Truth Determination**: Prioritized working code over outdated documentation
4. **Documentation Correction**: Decision D-25 corrects the record

**Pattern Applied:** Documentation Conflict Resolution Pattern (SP-8)
