```

**Critical Security Validation:**
```
For each potential security issue:
1. Confirm it's actually sensitive data (not examples/templates)
2. Determine if it's historical reference vs. active secret
3. Verify no actual credentials are exposed
4. Document security status and any required actions
```

### Hour 5-6: Conflict Detection

4. Document discrepancies between claims and reality

Example Verification:
Decision: "Updated environment variables from X to Y"
Verification: Check actual code files for variable usage
Result: Matches/Conflicts with claimed implementation
```

```

**Example Resolution Process:**
```
Issue: Environment variable naming conflict
Steps:
1. Examine code: grep -r "GITHUB_TOKEN\|GH_TOKEN" src/
2. Document findings: 56 references to GH_TOKEN* pattern
3. Create correction decision with evidence
