# ConPort Data Governance Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Project:** Copilot API (ekartashov fork)  
**Scope:** Ongoing ConPort maintenance and quality assurance

---

## Framework Overview

This governance framework establishes **systematic processes for maintaining ConPort data quality** and ensuring continued AI agent effectiveness. Based on the successful cleanup audit that achieved 35% knowledge graph connectivity and resolved all critical conflicts.

### Governance Principles

1. **Proactive Quality Assurance**: Prevent issues before they impact AI agents
2. **Evidence-Based Maintenance**: All documentation must align with implementation
3. **Sustainable Processes**: Governance overhead should enhance, not hinder productivity
4. **Strategic Knowledge Building**: Continuous enhancement of the knowledge graph
5. **Security-First Operations**: Regular security assessments and vulnerability prevention

## Relationship Management Guidelines

### Strategic Relationship Building

#### Relationship Type Vocabulary

**Implementation Relationships:**
- `implements` - Decision executes a system pattern
- `validates_implementation_of` - Confirms implementation success
- `builds_on` - Incremental development progression
- `extends` - Adds functionality to existing implementation

**Evolution Relationships:**
- `culminates_in` - Design process leads to final decision
- `supersedes` - Replaces previous approach
- `refines` - Improves existing solution
- `iterates_on` - Incremental improvement cycle

**Problem-Solution Relationships:**
- `identifies_problem_solved_by` - Problem identification and solution link
- `addresses_concern_in` - Resolves specific concerns
- `resolves` - Direct problem-solution mapping
- `mitigates_risk_in` - Risk reduction relationship

**Context Relationships:**
- `provides_context_for` - Background information relationship
- `clarifies` - Explanation or clarification link
- `documents_decision_for` - Decision documentation link
- `tracks_progress_of` - Progress monitoring relationship

#### Relationship Quality Standards

**Meaningful Connection Criteria:**
1. **Clear Value**: Relationship enhances understanding
2. **Accurate Type**: Relationship name correctly describes connection
3. **Bidirectional Sense**: Makes sense from both item perspectives
4. **Strategic Importance**: Contributes to knowledge graph goals

**Quality Assessment Questions:**
- Does this relationship help AI agents make better decisions?
- Would removing this relationship reduce understanding?
- Is the relationship type the most accurate description?
- Does this connection create valuable knowledge paths?

### Network Optimization Strategies

#### Hub Management
**Optimal Hub Characteristics:**
- **Central Decisions**: Final designs, critical resolutions
- **Foundation Patterns**: Broadly applicable system patterns
- **Quality Anchors**: High-quality, well-documented items

**Hub Overload Prevention:**
- **Distribution Target**: No single hub >15% of total connections
- **Load Balancing**: Spread connections across multiple relevant hubs
- **Strategic Splitting**: Create sub-hubs for specialized domains

#### Connectivity Enhancement
**Target Areas for Connection:**
- **Isolated Patterns**: Connect to implementing decisions
- **Orphaned Decisions**: Link to relevant patterns or contexts
- **Cluster Bridges**: Connect related but separate knowledge areas

**Connection Strategies:**
- **Progressive Linking**: Build connections incrementally
- **Thematic Clustering**: Group related items through shared connections
- **Bridge Building**: Connect previously isolated knowledge areas

## Cache Optimization Strategy

### Content Identification for Caching

#### High-Priority Cache Candidates
**Product Context:**
- **Cache Priority**: High (stable, frequently referenced)
- **Cache Hint**: Add `"cache_hint": true` to metadata
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly or major changes only
- **Token Impact**: ~2000 tokens, high reuse value

**Core System Patterns:**
- **Cache Priority**: Medium-High (stable, reusable)
- **Selection Criteria**: Patterns referenced in >3 decisions
- **Update Frequency**: Semi-annual or significant changes
- **Token Impact**: ~500-1000 tokens each, moderate reuse

**Strategic Decision Summaries:**
- **Cache Priority**: Medium (moderately stable, valuable context)
- **Selection Criteria**: Final design decisions, critical resolutions
- **Update Frequency**: Stable after implementation
- **Token Impact**: ~300-800 tokens each, good reuse value

#### Cache Hint Management

**Adding Cache Hints:**
```
When logging large, stable content:
"metadata": {
  "cache_hint": true,
  "cache_reason": "Large stable content for frequent reference",
  "estimated_tokens": 2000
}
```

**Cache Hint Criteria:**
- **Size**: >750 tokens
- **Stability**: Infrequent updates expected
- **Reuse**: Referenced in multiple contexts
- **Value**: High importance for AI agent context

### Provider-Specific Implementation

#### Gemini API (Implicit Caching)
**Strategy:** Stable prefix structuring
```
1. Retrieve cache-hinted content from ConPort
2. Place at absolute beginning of prompts
3. Append variable content after stable prefix
4. Let Gemini manage implicit caching automatically
```

**Prompt Structure:**
```
[Product Context + Core Patterns + Strategic Decisions]

--- TASK-SPECIFIC CONTENT ---

[User question/task]
[Recent activity context]
[Specific analysis requirements]
```

#### Anthropic API (Explicit Caching)
**Strategy:** Cache control breakpoints
```
1. Structure prompts with cache control markers
2. Insert breakpoints after stable content blocks
3. Use cache_control API parameters
4. Monitor cache hit rates and efficiency
```

#### OpenAI API (Automatic Caching)
**Strategy:** Consistent prefix structure
```
1. Maintain consistent prompt prefixes
2. Leverage automatic caching for >1024 token prefixes
3. Benefit from 50% token discount on cached content
4. Structure for maximum cache hit probability
```

### Cache Performance Monitoring

#### Metrics to Track
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of prompts using cached content
- **Token Savings**: Reduction in input token costs
- **Latency Improvement**: Response time benefits
- **Cache Staleness**: Frequency of cache invalidation needs

#### Optimization Actions
- **Content Updates**: Refresh cached content when necessary
- **Structure Improvements**: Optimize prompt structure for caching
- **Hint Refinement**: Adjust cache hints based on performance
- **Provider Switching**: Leverage best caching provider for use case
